            When we plan to go somewhere new, whether that be a beach,
            a board game cafe, or even a new city,
            what's the first thing that we do?
            We look it up online!

            These days,
            it's vital to have a solid source of information on the web
            in order to attract new customers and keep current ones updated.
            When potential customers are given a choice
            between two similar business options,
            having a strong online presence can tip the scales in your favour.

            This is where I come in!
            I will work with you to create a custom informational website,
            or web app, that can attract potential customers and communicate
            the unique benefits that your company has to offer.
